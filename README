EZIM is an instant messenger application for the intranet network that supports online status notification, file transmission and real time chat with computers connected via LAN. It does not need a centralized server, instead it just finds all other users within the same network by obtaining their IP address from the DHCP server. It runs on a Java Virtual Machine, therefore it works on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux platforms.
